**What is your previous experience with computers, computer science and code? For
example, have you never really had an interest before? Are you a gamer who has modded
games? Have you tried coding a little?**
I don't really have much prior experience with computer science and coding. I've only learned the basics of how HTML works. I've never tried coding before.

**What made you interested in coding and decide to go to school to learn programming?**
I've always been interested in using computers and I like design too because I like to create things, therefore I thought I could try to combine my interests and learn coding.

**What technology did you grow up with? Did you experience the world before Google and
smartphones? If not, how do you think it might have been different from
navigating daily life without instant access to services, information, and
communication?**
I'm 22 years old and I grew up with tv, radio, phones. Social media och smartphones came when I was in elementary school and it changed everything. Information was spread quickly and how we interacted with each other changed. Everyone started living more online than offline. I think the world would have been a bit more slow without internet and the instans access to everything and everyone, and perhaps also wouldn't made us not compare us to others as much as we do now on social media.

**How does technology impact you positively, as well as negatively?**
Positively:
* Help with getting information with google, ChatGPT, YouTube etc. Endless of resources.
* Being able to stay in touch with loved ones who live far away
* Storing important documents and files digitally on clouds, easier to acess from differens devices
* If we use technology right it can help us be more effective

**Negatively:**
* It can be a distraction, instead of doing what I'm supposed to do I end up wathcing social media, tv etc...
* Sometimes it makes us connect less when all of us are being on our phones instead of actually being in the moment and be social
* We are sometimes too dependent on the technology to live our lives. We're almost obsessed with our phones, we take them everywhere, wherever we go and we feel stressed when we don't have access to internet. It shouldn't be like that

**Have you ever thought about how your personal data is used by companies? How do you
feel about the way big data shapes your online experiences?**
I'm only scared that companies or apps uses my mic or camera to spy on me, but hopefully no one does, I'm probably just paranoid. But sometimes it can feel a bit scary when ads are showing you exactly what you've been looking at before, or talking about.

**Have you tried using ChatGPT or other generative AI tools in your work or hobbies? How
did they help or change the way you approach tasks?**
Yes, I've used ChatGPT to learn and to help me correct me when learning languages and also to help me explain thing I didn't understand. It was also a fun way to spend time to talk with ChatGPT. I haven't tried AI in art or sound, but I've seen it. Seems interesting and as an effective way to genereate videos and pictures although it replaces real artists who put in hours of work into art pieces, it doesn't seem fair sometimes.

**Do you see code as logic or communication? What might be the benefit of each
perspective?**
I think I see it as logic. If you see it as logic it'll probably help you when write the code in a logical order to get wanted results, but I guess you can also see it as communication to both the machine and maybe to the user as well, to make sure it works flawless on both ends.

**What mental skills listed in ‚ÄúProgramming Mentality‚Äù do you find challenging? Write one
actionable way to improve in that area!**
I think I found it a bit challenging how to create the statements using only true/false to get wanted results, but I think I just need to think first about what I want the code to do first and then create the statement based on it.

**What did you expect from this course?**
I expect it to be a fun course where I can learn a lot within webdevelopment to be able to get a job after graduation.

**Did you learn what you thought you would during this course? If not, what would you
have wanted to be different?**
In this intro-course I learned how to set up github, git, what markdown is and how to use the most basic commands in the terminal.

**What did you enjoy most about this course, and what would you have liked to see more
of?**
I thought it was pretty fun to learn about the terminal and how to use it. I like to test things practically. It was a bit hard to understand how to upload to gitbash from my computer because I got error messages quite often and didn't really understand why.
